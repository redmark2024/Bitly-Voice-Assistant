Sure! Here's a full list of **installation commands** (using `pip`) for all the libraries you're importing in your script:

### ✅ Required Installations (via `pip`)
Open a terminal or command prompt and run these:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyautogui
pip install pyttsx3
pip install keyboard
pip install pillow
pip install customtkinter
pip install psutil
```

### 🛠️ Additional Requirements

Some libraries are **built-in** or **Windows-specific**, so here's more detail:

- ✅ **Built-in with Python (no need to install):**
  - `os`, `sys`, `time`, `threading`, `json`, `re`, `subprocess`

- 🪟 **Windows-specific (comes with Windows + Python for Windows):**
  - `win32gui`, `win32con`, `win32process`, `winreg`  
    → These are part of **pywin32**, so install with:
    ```bash
    pip install pywin32
    ```

- 🌐 `webbrowser`, `tkinter`:
  - `webbrowser` is built-in.
  - `tkinter` is included with standard Python installs, but if missing:
    - For **Windows**: Install a complete Python version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
    - For **Linux (like Ubuntu)**:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install python3-tk
      ```

### 💡 Optional tip:

To install everything in one go:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyautogui pyttsx3 keyboard pillow customtkinter psutil pywin32
```

Let me know if you want a `requirements.txt` or if you're running into issues while installing anything.
